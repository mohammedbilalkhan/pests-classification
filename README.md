# Pest Classification using  Simple CNN, DesNet 121, ResNet 50, and MobileNetV2.

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning system capable of accurately identifying different types of agricultural pests. Precise pest identification is crucial in agriculture, as it enables timely pest management, reducing crop losses and enhancing food security. In this project, we implemented and evaluated four machine learning models, all of which achieved perfect classification results.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains labeled images of various agricultural pests. Each image is associated with a specific pest category, allowing the models to learn distinguishing features for accurate classification.

## Libraries and Tools
To accomplish this, we utilized several libraries and tools:
- **Python**: Core programming language for data preprocessing and model implementation.
- **Pandas & Numpy**: For data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: Used to implement and evaluate traditional machine learning algorithms.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: To build and train deep learning models.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization and to plot model performance.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: As the development environment for iterative coding and visualization.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Images were resized, normalized, and labeled to ensure consistency and optimize input for the models.
2. **Model Selection**: Four models were chosen for evaluation, each with different architecture and training parameters to capture various aspects of the data.
3. **Training and Validation**: The models were trained using a combination of hyperparameter tuning and validation techniques to avoid overfitting and to achieve robust results.
4. **Evaluation**: Each model's performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

## Results and Achievements
After training, all four models demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving an accuracy of 1.00. The classification reports indicate perfect classification across all pest categories, suggesting that the models effectively learned the distinguishing features of each pest type. This result shows that our approach is highly effective, making these models suitable for practical deployment in agricultural pest detection systems.

## Conclusion
The classification reports demonstrate the robustness of the models trained on the agricultural pest dataset, achieving an accuracy of 1.00 across all classes. These results imply that each model can reliably identify and classify agricultural pests, providing a practical solution for automated pest detection. This system, if deployed, could assist farmers in pest management by accurately identifying threats to crops.

## Future Work
To further enhance this project, future work could include:
- Expanding the dataset to include more pest categories and images.
- Experimenting with other advanced machine learning and deep learning architectures.
- Developing a real-time mobile application for pest identification in the field.
